# Asteroids

![Screenshot of Asteroids](screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

**Warning** - this project wasn't brought to an end, but you can still play it, if moving and circling around with the spaceship is enough for you :)

To run it you'll firstly need to compile the source code, and to do so run
```
g++ -c main.cpp Ship.cpp && g++ Ship.o main.o -o sfml-app -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```

Later, to play it, type
```
./sfml-app
```


Hope you like this half-finished project :)
